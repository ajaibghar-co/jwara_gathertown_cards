The Annamma Devi Temple was built in the 15th Century by Chieftain Hanumantha Nayaka under the reign of Immadi Gowda. The temple housed ancient idols unearthed by Nayaka during the digging and construction of the Dharmambudhi Tank (a lake reservoir). Presently, the tank is now the Majestic Bus Station, and sits adjacent to the Annamma Temple on Subedar Chatram Road.
