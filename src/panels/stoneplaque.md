This Annamma Devi Temple was built in the 15<sup>th</sup> Century by Chieftain Hanumantha Nayaka under the reign of Immadi Gowda. The temple was built to house ancient idols unearthed by Nayaka during the digging and construction of the Dharmambudhi Tank, (present day Majestic Bus Station), neighbouring the temple in Gandhi Nagar.
