The Annamma Devi Temple was built in the 15th Century by Chieftain Hanumantha Nayaka under the reign of Immadi Gowda (son of Kempe Gowda I, founder of Bengaluru). The temple housed ancient idols unearthed by Nayaka during the digging and construction of the Dharmambudhi Tank (lake reservoir), which is present day Majestic Bus Station adjacent to the temple.
