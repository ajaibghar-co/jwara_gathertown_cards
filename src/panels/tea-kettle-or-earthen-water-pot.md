Soon after the typhoid bacteria was discovered in the 1880s, a laboratory was set up in Bengaluru to test patients, food and water. In most areas of India, water was brought for the cantonment from nearby lakes and tanks (reservoirs) to peopleâ€™s houses by water carriers or Beestis, in leather skins and earthen pots. By the end of the 19th Century, the British increasingly began to boil or filter water using new technologies like the Pasteur filter.
