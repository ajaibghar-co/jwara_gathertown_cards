Since neither typhoid nor antibiotics had not been discovered yet, patients were given all kinds of treatments. The wonder medicine most effective for Malaria treatment was given instead, Quinine! Patients were also prescribed laxatives, sweat-inducing medicines, and even mercury to clear out the body, while nourishing them with Beef Tea, Chicken Soup and sips of Wine or Brandy. For typhoid patients, these treatments did more harm than good, with many dying in the hospitals itself!
