The new extensions of Bangalore were built with great detail to cleanliness and aesthetics. The symmetrical streets had conservancy lanes attached to the back of the houses for scavengers and carts to be brought to manually remove human waste ‘conservatively’. During the 1930s, health officers often complained that the conservancy lanes were being used for open defecation by the public and by those who could not afford sanitation services. Suitable underground sewage systems were proposed since the scavengers could not keep up with the growing number of houses to clean.
