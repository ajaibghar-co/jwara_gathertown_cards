Moorthy observed that each street had built in drains and conservancy lanes behind each row of houses for scavengers to manually collect human waste and cart it away ‘conservatively’. During the 1930s, health officers complained that scavengers were overwhelmed with the growing number of houses to clean. Moreover, the conservancy lanes were being used for open defecation by homeowners who could not afford the sanitation services.
