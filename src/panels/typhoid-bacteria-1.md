Typhoid is an ancient companion of humanity. Over the centuries, it has claimed an untold number of lives around the world. The Typhoid bacteria (S. Typhi) was identified during the 1880s and effective vaccines and antimicrobials were developed to prevent and treat it from 1896 and 1948. However, the most important way of typhoid prevention remains the provision of clean water, safe food, and effective sewage disposal.
