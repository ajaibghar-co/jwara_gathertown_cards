The quadrangle in the centre of the outer room, called the Bisilu Maaramma (Kannada for mother of disease and fever), is for worshippers to place their offerings, usually milk or curd, as a symbol of cooling the anger of the goddess. The wearing of amulets is a sign of protection of the goddess from ill health and bad luck. Infants are laid in front of Bisilu Maaramma to ward off evil spirits that are believed to manifest in the form of fevers, pox and skin diseases.
