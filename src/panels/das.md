The quadrangle in the centre of the outer room is for Bisilu Maaramma (Kannada for mother of disease and fever). It is for worshippers to place their offerings, usually milk or curd, as a symbol of cooling the anger of the fever goddess. Infants are laid in front of the Bisilu Maaramma quadrangle to ward off evil spirits that are believed to manifest as fevers, pox and skin diseases. Further inside, amulets are adorned as a sign of protection under the goddess from ill health and bad luck.
