The quadrangle in the centre of the outer room, for *Bisilu Maaramma* (*Bisilu* meaning heat), is for worshippers to place their offerings, pouring milk or curd as a symbol of cooling the anger of the goddess. The wearing of amulets is a sign of protection of the goddess from ill health and bad luck. Upon recovering from illness, the patient must visit the temple and show gratitude to the goddess within 14 days. Infants are brought and laid down in front of *Bisilu Maaramma* for blessings to ward off evil spirits that manifest in the form of fevers, pox and skin diseases.
