Once in the body, typhoid bacteria travel through the intestine and enter the bloodstream. From there, they spread all over the body, reproducing more bacteria.  This overwhelms the body’s immunity. The main symptoms of typhoid are stomach pain, high, spiking  fever, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, headaches and fatigue. If left untreated, up to 1 in 5 typhoid patients may die.
