Worshippers have created large markets outside temples, selling customary offerings of cooling foods such as curd, milk, turmeric, curd rice, salt, and neem leaves to abate the heat of the fever goddesses. Offerings are also a way of thanking the goddess for conception, birth or the recovery of a child from illnesses.
