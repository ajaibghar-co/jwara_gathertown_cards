The Typhoid vaccine has not been included in the list of mandatory vaccines for all children in India, so it is usually given after a local outbreak. People rely heavily on antibiotics to help them, which has led to the rise of antibiotic resistant strains. There  have been outbreaks of these resistant strains in Bangalore since as early as 1991! Cases become serious when even the harshest antibiotics can not help!
