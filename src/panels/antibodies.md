The best way to wipe out a virus is to innoculate all populations. That means to vaccinate everybody! Give a small dose of either the virus or the antibodies that fight it so our body learns how to fight it too! In India, the Typhoid vaccine is not given to all children like small pox and the others. They only give it when there is an outbreak. 

The Typhoid vaccine has not been included in the list of mandatory vaccines for all children in India, so it is usually given after a local outbreak. People rely heavily on antibiotics to help them, which has led to the rise of antibiotic resistant strains. There  have been outbreaks of these resistant strains in Bangalore since as early as 1991! Cases become serious when even the harshest antibiotics can not help!
