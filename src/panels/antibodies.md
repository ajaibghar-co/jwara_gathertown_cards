Vaccines fight off infections like typhoid. Give a small dose of either the virus or the antibodies that fight it and our body learns how to fight it too! In India, the Typhoid vaccine is not given to all children like small pox and the others. It is only when there is a local outbreak. Antibiotics are also used to fight infectious bacteria like typhoid, but by taking too much, too often, and without doing tests first, bacteria learn to resist antibiotics! There have already been outbreaks of Typhoid resistant strains in Bangalore since as early as 1991, where even the harshest antibiotics are not stong enough!
