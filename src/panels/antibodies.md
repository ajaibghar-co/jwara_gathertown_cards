Typhoid is a bacterial infection caused by the germ Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. The most common sources of infection are water, leafy vegetables, milk, and other beverages that have been contaminated with human faeces. We can prevent typhoid through safe water supplies, effective sewage, and good hygiene practices like washing hands with clean water and soap and preventing carriers such as flies from contaminating foodstuffs.
