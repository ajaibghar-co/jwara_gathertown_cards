In 1537, Kempe Gowda I founded the New town of Bangalore and made it his capital. He built a mud fort for protection and the pete or the town came up near the fort. During the time of Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan a stone fort was built and it was only during the British period Bangalore was divided into the old Pete area (Native town) and the British Cantonment. After the plague epidemic of 1899 new residential extensions in Bangalore were planned for sanitation purposes.
