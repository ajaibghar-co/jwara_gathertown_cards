In 1537, Kempe Gowda I founded the new town of Bangalore and made it his capital. He built a mud fort for protection with the 'Pete' or neighbouring town. A stone fort was built over the mud fort, during the time of Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan. The imperial British divided Bangalore into the old Pete area (Native town) and the British Cantonment  for their military station.

After the plague epidemic of 1899 new residential extensions in Bangalore were planned for sanitation purposes.
