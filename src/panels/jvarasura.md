It was in 1537 that Kempe Gowda I founded Bangalore and made it his capital. He built a mud fort for himself and established the Pete as a living quarter for ordinary citizens. During the time of Sultan Hyder Ali (1762 - 1799) rebuilt the fort with stone. Soon afterwards, the British stationed here divided Bangalore into the old Pete area (Native town) and the new British Cantonment next to it.
