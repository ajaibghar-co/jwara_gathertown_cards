In 1537, Kempe Gowda I founded Bangalore and made it his capital. According to legends, he built a mud fort for himself, and established the Pete (peɪteɪ), a living quarter for ordinary citizens, and watchtowers bordering his kingdom. The fort was lost and rebuilt nearby by later rulers, but the Pete was established where the old fort stood . In 1806, the British stationed here divided Bangalore into the old Pete area (Native town) and the new British Cantonment next to it.
