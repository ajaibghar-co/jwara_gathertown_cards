As a result of a plague outbreak between 1898-1899, new residential extensions of *Basavanagudi*, *Chamrajpete* and *Malleshwaram* were planned away from the Pete city area. Planned by a British municipal engineer and executed by the Dewan (Minister) of Princely Mysore, these new extensions were called the ‘model hygienic suburbs’, with special attention to cleanliness and aesthetics. Houses were allotted by religion and caste, with preference given to upper caste Hindu government employees.
