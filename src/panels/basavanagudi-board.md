Due to overcrowding in the centre of the city, new residential extensions of *Basavanagudi*, *Chamrajpete* and *Malleshwaram* were planned away area through the 1880s. Planned by a British municipal engineer and executed by the Dewan (Minister) of Princely Mysore, these new extensions paid special attention to cleanliness and aesthetics. Houses were allotted by religion and caste, with preference given to upper caste Hindu government employees.
