Vaccines can help to prevent infections like typhoid. It trains the bodyâ€™s immune system to fight a disease it has not come into contact with yet. Antibiotics are medicines that can treat active infections, by killing the bacteria or stopping it from reproducing. However, bacteria can develop resistance to the effects of an antibiotic, but we can prevent that by using them only when necessary. There have already been antibiotic resistant Typhoid strains in Bangalore since as early as 1991, where even the strongest antibiotics can not fight the typhoid bacteria!
