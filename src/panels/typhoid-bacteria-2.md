Through better vaccines, hygiene, chlorinated water and improved public health, Typhoid infection rates have declined worldwide. But in India, due to poor sanitation, contaminated foods and inaccessible healthcare, Typhoid infection rates remain in a consistent pattern. The Southern state of Karnataka is no different, including the capital city of Bangalore. Globally 1 in 4 infected cases of Typhoid are fatal primarily due to lack of healthcare. Typhoid is difficult to diagnose in developing areas and therefore is studied as a case of “presumptive enteric fever”.
