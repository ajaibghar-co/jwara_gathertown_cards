Considering the caste prejudice we face, very few of us got to go to school, we manage with what we have. We all work cleaning floors and toilets, in different places, for very little money. But even though our families have been doing this work for generations, we try to protect our children, give them better lives. Even if that means hiding our caste and work from people. There's an advocate who's come to discuss our problems, you can go meet him too.
