We clean floors and toilets in different places, but for very little money. Even though our families have been doing this work for generations, we try to protect our children, and hope to give them better lives. With the prejudice we face for being lower caste, very few of us got to go to school. So we have managed with what we have, but we protect our children. We make sure they get an education, even if we have to hide our caste and the work we do. Things canâ€™t go on like this and we are beginning to organise. There is an advocate who has been visiting us to help, you can go meet him too.
