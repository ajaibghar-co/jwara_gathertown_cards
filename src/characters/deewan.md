This enterprise in municipal engineering, clean water supply and proper sanitation, has all been led by the Mysore Princely State. The construction of these towns started in this ‘Modern Twentieth Century’, on par with any developed Western town in the World. While the crowded city areas are festering with plague and disease, these extensions will be a clean and open paradise.
