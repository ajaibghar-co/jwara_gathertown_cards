Thank you for visiting this modern suburbia! Clean water supply and sanitation systems will really transform the city. Work here was directed by the Mysore Princely State with thoughtful foresight on par with any developed Western town in the world. And thank goodness Basavanagudi is ready now in 1898, just as the plague is wreaking havoc in the inner city!
