I have been collecting reports on the health of our soldiers here since the 1860s, for Florence Nightingale. She has to report on the situation here as a nurse and statistician. Some of my colleagues think that the air here is polluted, I think that it is the water. Itâ€™s nearly impossible to get clean water for all the soldiers. The toilet systems are terrible and the locals are contaminating our tanks. I also think that some of the water sacks used by our local water carriers look quite unclean. I apologise, I must return to my research. Patients are dying here, if they risk coming to the hospital at all!
