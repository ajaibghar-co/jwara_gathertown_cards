My reports are for Florence Nightingale, the famous nurse and statistician in Britain. She has been tasked with reporting on the situation here. Some of my colleagues think that the air here is polluted, but I think it is the water. Itâ€™s difficult to get clean water for all the soldiers, the toilet systems are terrible and the locals are contaminating our tank. Even the water sacks used by Bheesties, our local water carriers, look quite unclean. I apologise, I must go. Patients are dying here, if they risk coming to the hospital at all!
