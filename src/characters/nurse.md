I suppose you've been told about these awful typhoid outbreaks. The continuous fever spells out Typhoid clearly. I've been collecting reports on the health of soldiers here as directed by Florence Nightingale, but really I think it's the water. The toilets here are terrible, most of it goes into undrained cesspools. Itâ€™s difficult to maintain the quality of the water transported by local water carriers. I apologise, I must return to my research, patients are dying here, if they risk coming to the hospital at all!
