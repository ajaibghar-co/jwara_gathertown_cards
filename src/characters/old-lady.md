When I was a child, This town (Bengaluru) was a village, just the Pete area next to the fort. Now they have added this cantonment area for the British military and many more people have now moved to Bengaluru to find work. The city is slowly consuming all the villages around it. It is not even mid-1800s, and the city is already large and congested. You can go to the cantonment hospital where they are studying the diseases now. They only started caring when the soldiers were getting sick.
