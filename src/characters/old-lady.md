When I was a child, Bengaluru was just a village. Now they have added this cantonment area for the British military and many more people have now moved to here to find work.  It is not even mid-1800s, and the city is already large and congested. You can go to the cantonment hospital where they are studying the diseases now. They only started caring when the soldiers were getting sick and they keep blaming the diseases on us locals.
