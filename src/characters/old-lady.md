This town was so small, just the Pete area next to the fort was the city. Now they have added this new cantonment area also. The city is eating up all the villages around and becoming one big city. But it's also very congested, whole locality gets sick at once. Oh, you can meet the British nurse studying the sick soldiers at the Cant. hospital. They only started caring when the soldiers were getting sick.
