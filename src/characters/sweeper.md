Our families have been doing this work for generations, weâ€™re low caste so we do not get any other work. And with all the new cantonments, there is lots of work to do. The water carriers here bring water from the tank to help us wash and sweep away waste, but we are not allowed to use the water for ourselves. Or we spread out the waste from the flooding cesspools and let it dry, but sometimes it stays in the ground or the rains push it into the tank itself. We have to use our dry tools and wait till we go home to clean ourselves. Some people from our community have gone further south to find work in *Basavanagudi* where the new suburb has been built!
