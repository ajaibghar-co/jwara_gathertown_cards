Our families have been sweepers for generations. Weâ€™re low caste so we do not get any other work. And with all the new British stations, we get a lot of work but we still get paid very little. We clean toilets and remove faeces from overflowing sewage pits. Sometimes the waste seeps back into the tank here. But this water is for the cantonment only and we are not allowed to use it. Some people from our community have gone to find work in Basavanagudi in the new suburb!
