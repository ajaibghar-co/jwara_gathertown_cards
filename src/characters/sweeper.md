Our families have been sweepers for generations. Weâ€™re low caste so we do not get any other work. And with all the new British stations, we get a lot of work but we still get paid very little. We also manually remove human waste from the overflowing cesspools, spread it out and let it dry. Sometimes the waste seeps back into the Ulsoor tank. But we are not allowed to use the water here, we have to wait till we get home to clean ourselves. Some people from our community have gone to find work in Basavanagudi in the new suburb!
