My child got Typhoid after the recent monsoon floodings. Lots of people in *Basavanagudi* have gotten sick. My husband said it would be cleaner and safer here for our children. He works for the government so we got first preference to stay here. And now my childÂ  has to go to the hospital! You can go to talk to the man who was here researching Typhoid outbreaks.
