My child has had a fever since the recent monsoon floods. It must be typhoid! Lots of people in Basavanagudi have been getting sick. My husband said it would be cleaner and safer here for our children. He works for the government so we got first preference. I have to take my child to the hospital now! You can go talk to the government doctor who was here. He was researching typhoid outbreaks.
