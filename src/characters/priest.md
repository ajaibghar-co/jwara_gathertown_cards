This temple is devoted to Annamma Devi, our fever goddess. Most families coming here to worship have either recently suffered from a fever related illness or are praying for the protection of a loved one, usually their children. Annamma temple is more than just a shelter for the goddess, she is considered to be a guardian of Bengaluru. Our belief is that fever is a punishment from the goddess and the goddess must be appeased through offerings and worship after recovery.
