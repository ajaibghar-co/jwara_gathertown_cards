I am Narasimha Moorthy, a bacteriologist with the Public Health Institute. This area was built to protect from plague, but due to flaws in planning, outbreaks of typhoid have become common in the extensions in the past few years. I have been appointed to study the cause of these current outbreaks since 1930.
