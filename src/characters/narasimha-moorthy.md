I am Narasimha Moorthy, a scientist with the Public Health Institute. I study bacteria and diseases. This area was built to protect residents from plague, but due to flaws in planning, outbreaks of typhoid have become common in the extensions in the past few years. I have been appointed to study the cause of these current outbreaks since 1930. Hopefully, officials will listen to my findings!
