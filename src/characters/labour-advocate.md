Advocacy may have started as small public protests, but now many of us who come from these castes have managed to educate ourselves and are trying to fight for our community. We help sanitation workers in the area, through police complaints, court cases, protests, etc. Manual scavenging is not only an inhumane practice, but it is also deadly for those who come into contact with humanÂ  waste with no protection. They enter manholes with risks of accidents and asphyxiation. They have to unblock drains by carrying human waste, standing in pits and sweeping it away. We must think about what we simply flush away and who is forced to clean up our dirt for us.
