This may have started as small public protests among the workers and some advocates, but now many of us who come from these castes have managed to educate ourselves and are trying to fight for our community, for our families. Now that manual scavenging is illegal, we can help sanitation workers with police complaints, court cases and protests. It is so dangerous for those who come into contact with human waste with no protection. They can get injured, fall sick, or even drown while working. We must think about what we flush away in our toilets and who is forced to clean up the drains and sewage further on.
